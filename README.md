We’ve heard from developers the world over who want to make SITU-compatible apps… and now they can!

We’re very pleased to announce the SITU Scale iOS (and Cocoa) SDK. 

In it you’ll find:

* A library to talk to SITU scale.

* A sample app to see how to integrate the library.

This SDK can be used to create iPhone, iPad, and OSX apps for use with SITU Scale.
